# vue-dymo-js
VueJS plugin to interface with [DYMO Local Web Server](https://developers.dymo.com/)

## Who is this for?
If you are building a web application using VueJS and need a quick way to print labels using a
DYMO print, this component should fufil that need.

## How does it work?
Communication with hardware from the browser can be challenging. Thankfully the team at DYMO create a web server
your clients can install. This plugin acts a wrapper for the Javascript SDK to make communicating with their web server
easier

## How is this different from dymojs?
If have been looking for library that will help you connect to a DYMO printer you may have ran into [dymojs](https://github.com/dsandor/dymojs). I tried to use this module but started to notice that its age was starting to show in the documentation and also in the code itself. I was heavily inspired by that project to create a similiar project but up to date with the changes the DYMO team  has made.

## Tested Printers
DYMO Label Printer 450 Turbo
